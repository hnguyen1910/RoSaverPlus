</p>

## Instructions:
1. Create a group (or use a old group if you already had one) on an **ALT**, make sure you are **NOT** in that group.

2. Go to this [game](https://www.roblox.com/games/115958642324902/Uncopylocked-cool-game#!/) and click *Edit in studio*, then *Settings* and make sure to publish to your **OWN GROUP**, also turn on **Allow 3rd party sales** in *Security* or the 40% method will not work 

3. Click on extensions icon

4. Enter the **Place ID of your earlier published game** in textbox and click **Save**

5. Go to any item but limiteds (this method doesn't work on them i think)

6. Buy it with the SAVE button!

7. You will get 10% - 40% robux back to your group after 3-7 days

8. Join group in your main account and wait 21 days

9. Withdraw to your main account

10. Profit âœ‹!

*You can  buy item in-game too btw.*
